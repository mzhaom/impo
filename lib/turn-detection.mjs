// Per-agent turn detection: is the agent in a window actively working, or has
// its turn ended (idle, waiting for input)? Each agent exposes the signal
// differently, so detection is per agent type and uses the best signal:
//
//   - claude: the pane TITLE (set by Claude Code via OSC). While working it is
//     prefixed with a braille spinner glyph (U+2800–U+28FF, the cycling dots)
//     and shows the current task; when idle it's a steady marker like
//     "✳ Claude Code". Title is the agent's own status line — the cleanest cue.
//
//   - codex: codex does NOT put a status glyph in its title, so use the pane
//     FOOTER text — "Worked for …" / an interrupt hint means working; the model
//     status footer ("… Goal achieved", "Context …% left") / idle "›" prompt
//     means the turn ended.
//
// HONEST STATE (Wave 1). Detection returns a { state, confidence } pair:
//
//   state      = "working" | "idle" | "unverified"
//   confidence = "high" | "low"
//
// The cardinal rule (see docs/PRODUCT_CONTEXT.md → "Honest state language"): we
// never show false confidence. When the signal is missing or unrecognized — an
// agent we know is running but whose status line we cannot read — we return
// "unverified" (visible, ranked below confirmed items) rather than guessing
// "idle" or dropping the window. "unverified" is ALWAYS low confidence.
//
// All inputs are plain strings already stripped of ANSI by the caller.
