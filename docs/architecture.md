# IMPO architecture

A phone-friendly web UI for driving **tmux** on a remote machine. `server.mjs`
runs in three roles: a **controller** (hosted service that serves the
UI), an **agent** (runs next to tmux on your machine), and a **local** all-in-one
mode. The agent dials *out* to the controller over a WebSocket, so the machine
needs no inbound port.

## Request flow

```mermaid
graph TD
  Phone[Phone browser] -->|HTTPS| Controller[Hosted controller]
  Controller -->|WebSocket| Agent[Local agent]
  Agent -->|exec| Tmux[tmux server]
  Controller -->|transcribe / TTS / realtime| OpenAI[OpenAI API]
```

The browser only ever talks to the controller. The controller brokers every
tmux command to the right machine over the agent's outbound WebSocket.

## How a pane command travels

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant B as Browser
  participant C as Controller
  participant A as Agent
  participant T as tmux
  B->>C: POST /api/send (HTTPS)
  C->>A: tmux op (WebSocket)
  A->>T: send-keys
  T-->>A: ok
  A-->>C: result
  C-->>B: 200 OK
```

## Connection lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Connecting
  Connecting --> Online: hello accepted
  Online --> Reconnecting: socket drops / deploy
  Reconnecting --> Connecting: backoff
  Online --> [*]: stop
```

The agent keeps the link healthy with ping/pong liveness and re-dials onto a new
controller revision when it detects one (via `/api/health`), so a deploy never
leaves it pinned to old code.

## Smart content viewer

Paths to images and markdown files in the pane are clickable. The controller
reads the file **through the agent** (confined to the pane's working directory),
then the browser renders it inline — including the Mermaid diagrams on this page.
